title: Dear Human (unlikely)

Thanks for stopping by.

Kivi Studio is [[Ela Siwy]]'s playground. It's an umbrella term (and a [UK Limited company](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/13469571)) for all my experiments, aspiring to become a proper [[Studio]] (whatever that means). Here I aim to demonstrate that we can design differently – slowly, using scientific methodology, valuing human joy over productivity.

Currently, I am working on a family of products around physical books - [[Marginalia]]. t's built on the idea that reading books together creates shared knowledge and sparks better conversations.
